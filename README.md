# Practice Pedal

The Practice Pedal project was completed during **HackGT9 Retro Reset** and won the **Best Hardware Hack üõ†Ô∏è Award**! Check out our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/practice-pedals).

This project focuses on repurposing old guitar pedals into gamified devices to motivate kids to practice and get passionate about playing the electric guitar. We've done this by reading a voltage generated from the electric guitar into our pedal using signal processing (with an op-amp and full-wave rectifier to simplify playtime tracking), and using that data to track how long a player has been actively using the guitar while connected into our pedal with a connected Arduino Nano.


practice-pedal is a program loaded into the Arduino Nano used for the practice pedal project submitted at HackGT9.
