# Practice Pedal

The Practice Pedal project was completed during HackGT9 and won the Best Hardware Hack üõ†Ô∏è Award! Check out our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/practice-pedals)

This project focuses on repurposing old guitar pedals into devices to motivate kids to practice and get passionate about playing the electric guitar. We do this by reading a voltage generated from the electric guitar into our pedal using signal processing, and using that data to track how long a player has been actively using the guitar while having the aux connected into our pedal. The ped reads a voltage generated from an electrical guitar and measures how long the player has played in minutes. A certain amount of time played on the instrument for a consistent amount of time rewards players with candy.
practice-pedal is a program loaded into the Arduino Nano used for the practice pedal project submitted at HackGT9.
