# Practice Pedal

The Practice Pedal project was completed during **HackGT9 Retro Reset** and won the **Best Hardware Hack üõ†Ô∏è Award**! Check out our [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/practice-pedals).

This project focuses on repurposing old guitar pedals into devices to motivate kids to practice and get passionate about playing the electric guitar. We do this by reading a voltage generated from the electric guitar into our pedal using signal processing, and using that data to track how long a player has been actively using the guitar while connected into our pedal.


practice-pedal is a program loaded into the Arduino Nano used for the practice pedal project submitted at HackGT9.
